# Mission-to_Mars

## Overview of the Mission to Mars Challenge

In this Challenge, I was tasked to adjust the current web app to scrape images of the four hemispheres of Mars and include it in the app. To do this, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
